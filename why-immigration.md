# Why Immigation

People may consider emigration when:

## Life

1. No safe food and clean water. You want to eat the food you buy as you like without worrying about excessive additives, heavy metals or pesticides. You can drink water without worrying about excessive fluoride and chloride.
1. No clean air. You have to wear an anti-haze mask when you go out.
1. No real statistic data published by the government
1. Need to protect your houses from being forcibly demolished by the government because they want to reuse the land where your house is on. And you can only get a little payment that is not nearly enough to buy a house of the same size at the same location.
1. No way to express what has happened when you are suffering. If you speak out about your suffering on social media, it may result in your account being deleted. In extreme cases this can lead to you being imprisoned on false charges.
1. Need freedom to move within the country without being treated unfairly
1. Need freedom to move internationally without all kinds of obstruction

## Education

1. Need a scientific education, not the one that suppresses individuality and brainwashing
1. Need more professional vocational education
1. Need university professors to be more proficient in their profession rather than relying on political tactics to suppress students and other teachers

## Human rights

1. Need the right to reproduce freely, not to be controlled in how many children you can have
1. Need the right to have a free abortion, not to be restricted from having one
1. Need for freedom of expression without losing your job, being imprisoned or even dying for having expressed your opinion
1. Need freedom of the press, neutral reporting that allows viewers to understand the cause, rather than being strictly regulated news and topics.
1. Need privacy, without the fear of messages passed between two close friends being used as precision-selling advertising.

## Economy

1. Need the freedom to exchange foreign currency, not just a few thousand dollars a year

## Law

1. Need for sound and clear laws, not laws with blurred boundaries
1. Need for fair legal processes, not judges who can be bought off by connections and money
1. Need for the law to be followed, not internal documents, let alone verbal instructions

## Politics

1. Need for clean government, not corrupt government that relies on connections and money
1. Need for a clean army, not a corrupt one
1. Need professors who are competent, not academically fraudulent
1. Need good relations with neighbouring countries, not just with centralised governments
1. Need for a common sense change of state leadership, not a regression back to tenure
